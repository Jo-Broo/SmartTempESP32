# SmartTempESP32
I've come up with an Ideo for a self made Home Automation Sensor based on the ESP32 and a Server with is running on a Raspberry Pi.

My overall intention is to get myself more comfortable with Project Documentation and the thinking 'style' that comes with it.

There will be a lot of Diagrams at first but at this Point i already have a working Prototyp so the Code will follow shortly.


# Why Temperature ? 

The Temperature Measuring aspect was, at least for me, the easyest to start with but i already have other Ideas such as Watering and Measuring Air Quality.
There is really no limit on what you could include here because there are a lot of sensors available for the ESP Platform
